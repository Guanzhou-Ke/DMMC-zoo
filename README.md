# DMMC-zoo
This repos reproduced major variants of the Deep Multi-Modal Clustering algorithm via `pytorch`.


## Note

This is my first try to combine and reproduce the major variants of Deep Multi-Modal Clustering(DMMC) algorithms by `pytorch`. Because all of the DMMC algorithms were implemented on a different platform, such as `Tensorflow` or `pytorch`, it is challenging to do some experiments for the new one in the same environment. This repos will bring convenience to all of the researchers in DMMC.

## Environment

The detail see `requirements.txt`.

- python 3.8
- pytorch 1.7.1 (cuda 10.1)

## Algorithms

- [x] [DCCA an DCCAE](./DCCAE)
- [] [Deep Multimodal Subspace Clustering Networks(DMSC)](./)
